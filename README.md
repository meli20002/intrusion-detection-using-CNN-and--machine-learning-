# intrusion-detection-using-machine-learning-
This project uses machine learning and deep learning (CNN) to detect network intrusions based on the NSL-KDD dataset.

# Features
Data preprocessing and encoding
Neural network model for classification
Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
# Usage
Place the NSL-KDD data files in the data folder.
Run the notebook CNN.ipynb  to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.
Requirements
Python
PyTorch
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
# How it works
Categorical features are one-hot encoded.
Data is normalized.
A CNN model is trained to classify normal vs. attack traffic
